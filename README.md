# Student_preformance_prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict student performance (Pass/Fail) based on study hours and previous exam scores. It explores data, trains KNN, Logistic Regression, and SVM models, and evaluates their performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.

Features:
Predicts student outcomes (Pass/Fail)
Utilizes machine learning models
Data exploration and visualization
Handles class imbalance
Model evaluation and comparison

Tools:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Dataset:
Student exam data (study hours, previous scores, pass/fail)
